# intro_to_data_science
As part of an introductory course in data science we were asked to create a project on a topic of our choice.
In this project, we collected information from the Shufersal website about all food products in order to check whether there is a connection between the price of the product and its nutritional values in light of the growing strictness for labeling less healthy products.
My partner to this project was shira-chesler
